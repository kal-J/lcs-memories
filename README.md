# ABOUT LCS MEMORIES

Its December 2020, the world has been hit by covid-19. By God's Grace,
I'm done with my final semester exams and awaiting Graduation. Looking
through my phone and laptop, I'm overwhelmed by the number of photos I
find. These photos, taken from the time I was at campus (Lira
University) awaken so many awesome memories. I think of the best way to
share these memories with all the people I went to campus with and this
is how this project comes along.

## Project setup
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project also uses Firebase for authentication and storage of photos, so you might as well first setup a web project on firebase if you are looking into running your own copy of this.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
