        Its December 2020, the world has been hit by covid-19. By God's Grace,
        I'm done with my final semester exams and awaiting Graduation. Looking
        through my phone and laptop, I'm overwhelmed by the number of photos I
        find. These photos, taken from the time I was at campus (Lira
        University) awaken so many awesome memories. I think of the best way to
        share these memories with all the people I went to campus with and this
        is how this project comes along.
